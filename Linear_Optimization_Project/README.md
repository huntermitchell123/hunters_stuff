This is the final code and report for my linear optimization project. 

For this class, we were tasked with contacting a company and creating an optimization model based on the data and decisions that they make. I was fortunate enough to talk to people at the Spokane Transit Authority and come up with a problem representing bus route strategies. I created a model after considering practical constraints and decision variables, and tested the model on samples of various sizes. This was a really fun project to work on and I am very happy with my overall results!

# Miscellaneous Code Samples

From a linear optimization model to improve bus route scheduling to a multiple regression model which predicts movie popularity, here are some various projects that I have worked on over the years.

**Linear Optimization Project**

For my capstone project, I created a bus route optimization model based on conversations with people at Spokane Transit Authority. It was very exciting to work on something that could be of importance to such a large company. The model is tested with three various examples of different sizes using MATLAB.

# Miscellaneous Code Samples

From a linear optimization model to improve bus route scheduling to a multiple regression model which predicts movie popularity, here are some various projects that I have worked on over the years.

## Descriptions: 

**Craps**

From my computer science class, this program simulates the popular casino game Craps. 

**Linear Optimization Project**

For my capstone project, I created a bus route optimization model based on conversations with people at Spokane Transit Authority. It was very exciting to work on something that could be of importance to such a large company. The model is tested with three various examples of different sizes using MATLAB. 

**Math Game Executable** 

I wanted to play around with the curses library in Python, so I created a fun little math game to test your arithmetic. I then bundled it with pyinstaller so that anyone can run the game on their device!

**Hydrologic Event Poster**

With a team, we analyzed decades of data from the Nez Perce National Forest to identify hydrologic events (i.e. forest fires, floods, etc.) We ended up creating features vectors and implementing a support vector machine model.

**Kaggle Plant Pathology Competition**

The code from my first official Kaggle competition! The goal was to correctly classify the disease in pictures of apple leaves. I used an ensemble of different neural network architectures and managed to get in the top 13% out of over 1,300 teams!

**Movie Popularity Prediction**

This project attempts to answer the question of what makes a movie popular? I used a dataset of 5,000 movies to construct a multiple linear regression model with features like genre, budget, and runtime to predict a movies popularity. I also compared the regression model with several other models to see what performed the best. Check it out to see the results!

**Numerical Analysis Final**

On the more mathematical side, this was my final project for Numerical Analysis. It involves implementing several numerical approximation techniques in MATLAB and comparing them.  

**Compare Yourself Program**

Ever wondered what dog most resembles you? Now you can know! I made a program that goes through google images based on a search input (dog, cat, etc.), and shows the one that looks most structurally similar to you (or any other input image). Note: you must have a couple small things installed for this to run correctly, and also only works on Mac.

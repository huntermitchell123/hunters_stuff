To play the math game on your computer, you will need to download the math_game_bundle and then run the executable inside. There will most likely be privacy errors which can be bypassed in your privacy/security settings.

The math_game.py file just contains the code of the application. I used pyinstaller to bundle the application to be able to run on any device.

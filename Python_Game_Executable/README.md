To play this game on your computer, you will need to download the python_game_bundle and then run the python_game executable inside. The easiest way to download the folder is to go to http://kinolien.github.io/gitzip/, enter this URL https://github.com/huntermitchell123/misc/tree/master/Python_Game_Executable/python_game_bundle and hit download. There will most likely be security errors when trying to run the executable which can be bypassed in your system preferences.

The python_game.py file just contains the source code for the game. I used pyinstaller to bundle the application to be able to run on any device.
